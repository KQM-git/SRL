# Star Rail Library

The Theorycrafting Library (SRL) is a collection of community submitted knowledge and information about Honkai: Star Rail. The information and content found on the SRL has been vetted and checked by KQM's Theorycrafting Editors before being published.

The SRL is organized so that each page has a corresponding Evidence Vault. The Evidence Vault houses every submission in full that has been made to the SRL. While the main pages are where basic information and summaries of submitted findings can be found.

## Quick Links

**Most Recent Characters:** [Dan Heng • Imbibitor Lunae](/characters/imaginary/dan-heng-imbibitor-lunae)

**Most Recent Light Cones:** [Brighter Than the Sun](equipment/lightcones/destruction#brighter-than-the-sun) | [Solitary Healing](equipment/lightcones/nihility#solitary-healing)
