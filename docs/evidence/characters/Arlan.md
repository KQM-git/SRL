**Finding:**  
Arlan's A2 (which heals him when he defeats an enemy when he is below 30% HP) can be triggered by a DoT Shock applied by himself with a weakness break.  
  
**Evidence:**

**Significance:**  
good to know that Arlan can still heal himself in case he doesn't have quite enough damage to finish off an enemy.
