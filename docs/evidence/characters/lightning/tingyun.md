**Finding**
The targeted ally, not Tingyun herself is considered to 'own' the Additional Lightning Damage from Tingyun's Benediction buff. This notably results in Benediction damage scaling off not just ATK, but off the ally's other stats, such as Crit Rate, Crit Damage, and Lightning DMG%.

**Evidence:**
Those 3 videos show that the bonus hit is affected by the Crit Stats of the blessed ally:

This video shows that Lightning DMG% on Tinguyn and her Crit Stats doesn't affect the hit:

These video show that Tingyun does not receive on-kill energy if the enemy dies to the additional damage from Tingyun's talent, and the ally with Benediction does instead:

This spreadsheet shows that Lightning DMG% on an ally improves the damage of the bonus hit (there is a linked video in the doc as well):

**Significance:**
Discourages building Crit, and DMG%, as well as more ATK than is needed to reach the cap for Benediction on Tingyun instead of support stats like speed that are more encouraged. Incentivizes running Tingyun with a Lighning damage dealer (i.e. Jing Yuan, Serval) to take advantage of Benediction damage scaling off of their Lightning DMG%.
