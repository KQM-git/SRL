description: An Interastral Peace Corporation senior staff member with a minimal rank of project team leader. The mech they drive belongs to the IPC. If damaged, its repair fees have to be paid out-of-pocket. With a half-decent salary, they can at least afford to rent a one-bedroom apartment on one of the IPC's enterprise ships.
