description: Using fragments of the Dusk Leviathan as the foundation, and the weeping bones of thousands of the dead in the Warforge as the agent, the Antimatter Legion cast the Doomsday Beast. The resentful spirits' senseless obsession turns into a tangible hand, and the shadow of the old disaster conceals the heavens. The Doomsday Beast detains the will of all beings that are not at ease and have yet to die. Anger, mourning, or delusional joy â€” all is revealed, and all evil eagerly throb. The Doomsday Beast's core is a dark matter engine.
