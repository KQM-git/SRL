description: The replica of the Emanator of Propagation cultivated by Ruan Mei, briefly manifesting in the world in an incomplete form. Its original form is a giant lepisma that inherited the mandibles of the Imperator Insectorum. It can collect in its mouthparts the death ray that fragmented celestial bodies, and make shattered stars incubators for procreating offspring. It was once one of the nightmares across multiple worlds during the Swarm Disaster.
